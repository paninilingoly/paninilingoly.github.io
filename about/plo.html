                    <p>The Panini Linguistics Olympiad is the Indian national program for selection and training of the
                        candidates who represent India at the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL).
                    </p>
                    <p>The program is coordinated by Microsoft Research Labs India, International Institute of
                        Information Technology
                        Hyderabad, JNU Delhi and the University of Mumbai & is actively supported by regional
                        coordinators
                        across the country including Chennai Mathematical Institute, IIT Guwahati, SNLTR Kolkata, and

                    <li class="list-group-item">Round 1 is a national level test which typically comprises of about
                        5-6 problems to be solved in 4 hrs.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">These problems are all self-contained, i.e. unlike other
                        competitions, all the data you need to crack the whole thing, is in the problem itself,
                        thus, you are expected to sharpen logic and develop your own techniques to solve problems
                        from languages all over the world and uncover new features, that you might not have thought
                        of before! (In those 4 hrs itself).</li>

                        Thus, it also touches on the aspect of making you aware of what linguistics as a field is
                        and how interesting it can get. It gets one thinking on how to scientifically approach
                        something like a language, which they have been in contact with, â€˜foreverâ€™. After PLO, they
                        are enabled to look for patterns around them in languages and how they function.

                        Donâ€™t fret on preparation. If you still want to, feel free to explore the collection of past
                        PLO problems (under the Resources tab) ðŸ˜‰. They are arranged by their levels of difficulty,
                        so you can start with the light green problems and when you feel confident enough, move on
                        to the darker shades.

                        till 2015, after which International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad took
                        over.</li>

                        work on introducing linguistics, in its full glory, covering areas like phonology,
                        semantics, historical linguistics, computational linguistics etc. while also training the
                        students for the Olympiad, where you can solve some cool olmypiad problems based on what you
                        learn in the lectures.</li>
