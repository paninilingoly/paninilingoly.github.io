                    <p>Languages ​​are one of the most fascinating and core aspects of human culture and understanding.
                        The scientific look at one's own language, a lot of other languages ​​and forms of communication
                        other living beings as well, is an interesting area to study.</p>
                    <p>Where did languages ​​come from? Why are they so different? Do they have much in common? What is
                        the relationship between our languages ​​and our ways of thinking, feeling, and living? How do
                        languages ​​impact the society around us?</p>

                    <li class="list-group-item">Many people think that a linguist is someone who speaks many
                        languages and works as a language teacher or as an interpreter at the United Nations. In
                        fact, these people are more accurately called "Polyglots".</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">While many linguists are polyglots, the focus of linguistics is
                        about languages in general and not how many. To put it simply, linguistics is the scientific
                        study of language. It aims to understand how the language gets processed in the mind and how
                        language itself works. Linguists observe patterns within and across languages to try to
                        understand how and why they are different and what makes them alike.</li>

                        It comprises of sub-fields that cover: phonetics, phonology, morphology, semantics, syntax,
                        writing systems, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, computational linguistics,
                        psycholinguistics, pragmatics, applied linguistics, dialectology, comparative linguistics
